# poliTICS

This is my Final Research Project made at the end of my Bachelor's Degree in collaboration with GSI-UPM. It follows these steps:

   1. Data Scraping of information from public Facebook pages of main Spanish political parties such as reactions or comments.
   2. Sentimental Analysis of this information using Senpy.
   3. Storage of this information in Elasticsearch database.
   4. Creation of a dashboard in order to show these data, as it can be seen in the video demo provided.
